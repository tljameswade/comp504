WWJ_Demo READ_ME

This demo project contains many, many demos of the NASA WorldWind Java (WWJ) features.
Each demo has an associated ".launch" run configuration file.  To run a demo, simply 
highlight the associated run configuration file in Eclipse and click the "Run" button.

The "WWJ_Demo - MapController.launch" demo runs the code in the src directory and thus 
uses utilities provided by the "map" package.

The other demos run directly from the NASA WWJ library code, in the "libs/WWJ/code" folder.  
The source code for the demos can be found in "libs/WWJ/code/src/gov/nasa/worldwindx/".

Some demos may have trouble running because they require input files that are not where 
the demo application is looking for them.  Look in the demo source code to find the name 
of the referenced file. The files being referenced can usually be found under the 
"/libs/WWJ/code/src" folder.

If the referenced file is not found under the "src" folder, download the full WWJ distribution
at http://builds.worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/download-release.asp which will have all necessary files.
    
To run demos that require files, it is recommended that you disconnect the WWJ_Demo project 
from its read-only repository and re-commit it to your own personal repository.   Then you 
move files around and modify the source code so that the desired demos can run properly.

There are still many demos that are contained in the supplied libraries that do not have the
run configurations needed to run them.  To find them, simply search for "main(" in the 
"/libs/WWJ/code/src" directory.
