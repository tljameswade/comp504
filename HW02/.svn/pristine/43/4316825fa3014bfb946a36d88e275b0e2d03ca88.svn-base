ReadMe HW02:

This GUI app will load different kinds of balls as you wanted onto the canvas.
The balls are loaded onto the canvas from randomized initial locations with randomized initial colors.

We provide 4 kinds of balls here to choose:
1 StraightBall: This is the kind of ball type that will not change color or the way they move
2 ColorChangingBall: This kind of ball will change its color during movement
3 BreathingBall: This kind of ball will change its radius during movement
4 CurveBall: This kind of ball will rotate its direction during movement

All you need to do is to input the type of the ball you would like to load into the text frame in this format:
model.ball.XXX

XXX stands for any of the 4 kinds of balls

Then click the "Make Ball" button to initiate your ball loading process.

If you want to erase all of the balls on the canvas, just click "Clear All".
