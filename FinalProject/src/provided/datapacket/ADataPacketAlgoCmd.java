/**
 * A DataPacketAlgo command that is designed to work on a DataPacket&lt;D&gt; host.
 * <br>
 * This convenience class both simplifies the command code but also increase type safety by restricting the host type.
 * <br>
 * Usage:
 * <pre>
 * myDataPacketAlgo.addCmd(MyData.class, new ADataPacketAlgoCmd&lt;MyReturn, MyData, MyParam&gt;(){
 *     private static final long serialVersionUID = aGeneratedUIDvalue;
 *     
 *     public MyReturn apply(DataPacket&lt;MyData&gt; host, MyParam... params){
 *         // your code here
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Note:  In Eclipse, the auto-generation of the implemented methods of this class does not work properly.
 * The concrete apply method below is replicated by the automatic method generator because it doesn't 
 * recognize that the method already exists and is final.  Luckily, a compiler error message gets generated
 * in the attempt to override a final method.   Simply delete the extraneous auto-generated method.

 *
 * @param <R> The return type
 * @param <D> The data type held by the host
 * @param <P> The input parameter type 
 * @param <A> The type of the adapter to the local model
 * @param <H> The type of datapacket host the command should coerce the given host into when dispatching to the abstract apply() method.
 * * ----------------------------------------------
 * Restricts command to hosts of type ADataPacket
