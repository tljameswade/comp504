Overview: This simple program demonstrates a ball world that can make balls with abilities of chaning color, radius, velocity, direction. The type of strategies to move balls include String which moves straight and do not chaqnge ball state, Color which changes the color of balls, Breathing which changes ball radius within a predefined range, Curve which changes the direction at which balls move.

There are also different paint strategies to paint different kinds of balls, SquarePaint Strategy will paint a Non-affine transform-based rectangle, Ellipse will paint an affine transform-based Ellipse, Mario will paint a Mario that keeps up right, Saturn will paint a Saturn that keeps up right, CompositeShape will paint a composite Shape using existing shapes and keeps up right.

Available functions:
1 Type the name of the strategy into the left text input frame. These strategies are available:
	Straight
	Breathing
	Color
	Curve
	Wander
	AngryShaking
	
2 Clicking the "Add to Lists" button will add the strategy input from the text frame to both of the drop lists

3. Type the name of the paint strategy into the right text input frame. These strategies are available:
	CompositeShape
	Ellipse
	Mario
	Soccer
	Polygon
	Rectangle
	Saturn
	Square

4. Clicking the "Add " button will add the paint strategy input from the text frame to the drop list on right side.

5 Clicking "Make Selected Ball" will make a ball with the strategy selected on the top drop list

6 Clicking "Combine!" will dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists.
  The new generated strategy is then placed back into both drop lists and can be used again for combining.

7 Clicking "Make Switcher" button will make a ball, initially, ones that go straight

8 Clicking "Switch!" will cause all Switcher balls ever made to switch behaviors to whatever is the selected strategy on the top drop list. 
  Switcher balls made later will have the same behavior as whatever the previously made Switchers have.
