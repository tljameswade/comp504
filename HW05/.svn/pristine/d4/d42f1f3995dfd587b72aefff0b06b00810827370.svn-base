Overview: This simple program demonstrates a composition-based system to add dynamically modifiable behaviors loaded behaviors to the system

Available functions:
1 Type the name of the strategy into the text input frame. These strategies are available:
	Breathing
	Color
	Curve
	Wander
	AngryShaking
	
2 Clicking the "Add to Lists" button will add the strategy input from the text frame to both of the drop lists

3 Clicking "Make Selected Ball" will make a ball with the strategy selected on the top drop list

4 Clicking "Combine!" will dynamically create a strategy that is the combination of the strategies selected on top and bottom lists.
  The new generated strategy is then placed back into both drop lists and can be used again for combining.

5 Clicking "Make Switcher" button will make a ball, initially, ones that go straight

6 Clicking "Switch!" will cause all Switcher balls ever made to switch behaviors to whatever is the selected strategy on the top drop list. 
  Switcher balls made later will have the same behavior as whatever the previously made Switchers have.
