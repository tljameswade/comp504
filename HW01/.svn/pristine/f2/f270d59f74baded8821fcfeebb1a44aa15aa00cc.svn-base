This simple GUI app, when running, will automatically paint a red oval
and a yellow rectangle on the center panel.

There are three buttons on the lowest panel (south panel), Circle, Arc,
and Compound. When clicking Circle button, a magenta circle will appear on the center panel.
At the same time, the red oval still remains but the yellow rectangle disappears.

When clicking Arc button, a cyan Arc will appear on the center panel.
The center panel now contains both the Arc and the red oval.

When clicking compound, a orange rectangle and a cyan Arc will appear together on the
center panel.
The center panel has the red oval, together with the orange rectangle and the
cyan Arc.
